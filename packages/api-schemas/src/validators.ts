/**
 * Shared Zod refine helpers for adversarial-input hardening.
 *
 * These guard against inputs the ClickHouse client driver stalls on, which
 * surface as handler timeouts on ClickHouse-backed endpoints — specifically:
 *
 *   - JavaScript strings containing unpaired UTF-16 surrogates (e.g.
 *     `\udb14` without its low-surrogate pair). JS strings are UTF-16;
 *     ClickHouse stores UTF-8. Lone surrogates cannot encode to UTF-8 and
 *     cause the driver to stall mid-insert / mid-query.
 *
 *   - Dates outside ClickHouse's DateTime64 safe range. Years like 9416
 *     (year nine thousand four hundred sixteen) or 6382 overflow CH's
 *     internal representation and stall queries that compare against them.
 *
 * Applying these at the API boundary via Zod rejects adversarial inputs
 * fast (400) so ClickHouse never sees them. Used from `scores.ts`,
 * `traces.ts`, `sessions.ts`, `metrics.ts`, etc. — anywhere the gateway
 * forwards a query/insert to ClickHouse.
 *
 * Exported from the shared api-contract package so gateway, dashboard,
 * and anywhere else consuming the shared schemas get the same protection
 * without each call site having to remember.
